Description: The functioning of this package relies on utilizing a reference dataset that comprises clearly defined cellular types for individual cells, accompanied by computed feature markers. By employing a deep neural network (DNN) model, the package undergoes effective training to classify unknown cells present in new datasets from similar tissue samples. As a result, researchers gain valuable insights into cell type classification, even when dealing with datasets where cell types were previously unidentified.
